🔐 "Your MFA just got bypassed. Here's how I did it."

Day 1: The Setup
I registered a domain for a demo company and provisioned an Azure tenant. Using PowerShell, I created 29 test users in Entra ID (Azure AD). Everything looked legitimate. Security was enabled. MFA was mandatory.
The environment was "secure."
Or so it seemed.
Day 5: The Reconnaissance
Using AADInternals, I performed external reconnaissance:
→ Discovered the tenant ID without authentication
→ Enumerated valid user accounts
→ Mapped the organization's Azure footprint
→ Identified authentication methods
All of this from the OUTSIDE.
No credentials needed.
Day 12: The Infrastructure
I deployed Evilginx2 on a DigitalOcean VPS. This isn't your typical phishing tool. It acts as an adversary-in-the-middle, proxying authentication requests in REAL-TIME to Microsoft's servers.
The genius? It captures OAuth tokens, not just passwords.
Day 15: The Phishing Campaign
Crafted a convincing password reset email.
Embedded my lure URL.
Sent it to a test user.
The user clicked. ✅
Entered credentials. ✅
Completed MFA authentication. ✅
But here's the kicker...
Day 16: The Bypass
I now had their:
✓ Email
✓ Password
✓ Session token (with MFA validation embedded)
Using Cookie-Editor, I imported the captured token into my browser.
Navigated to Azure Portal.
I was in. No MFA prompt. No additional verification.
The token told Azure: "This user already authenticated with MFA."
