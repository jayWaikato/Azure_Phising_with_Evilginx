üîê **"Your MFA just got bypassed. Here's how I did it."**

Three weeks ago, I set myself a challenge:
Could I breach a cloud environment protected by Microsoft's Multi-Factor Authentication?

The answer shocked me.

Here's what happened: ‚¨áÔ∏è

**Day 1: The Setup**
I registered a domain for a demo company and provisioned an Azure tenant. Using PowerShell, I created 29 test users in Entra ID (Azure AD). Everything looked legitimate. Security was enabled. MFA was mandatory.

The environment was "secure."
Or so it seemed.

**Day 5: The Reconnaissance**
Using AADInternals, I performed external reconnaissance:
‚Üí Discovered the tenant ID without authentication
‚Üí Enumerated valid user accounts
‚Üí Mapped the organization's Azure footprint
‚Üí Identified authentication methods

All of this from the OUTSIDE. 
No credentials needed.

**Day 12: The Infrastructure**
I deployed Evilginx2 on a DigitalOcean VPS. This isn't your typical phishing tool. It acts as an adversary-in-the-middle, proxying authentication requests in REAL-TIME to Microsoft's servers.

The genius? It captures OAuth tokens, not just passwords.

**Day 15: The Phishing Campaign**
Crafted a convincing password reset email.
Embedded my lure URL.
Sent it to a test user.

The user clicked. ‚úÖ
Entered credentials. ‚úÖ
Completed MFA authentication. ‚úÖ

But here's the kicker...

**Day 16: The Bypass**
I now had their:
‚úì Email
‚úì Password  
‚úì Session token (with MFA validation embedded)

Using Cookie-Editor, I imported the captured token into my browser.
Navigated to Azure Portal.

**I was in. No MFA prompt. No additional verification.**

The token told Azure: "This user already authenticated with MFA."
